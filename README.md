 
This is the repo for my personal website nealmick.com

The site is built using the Django library and includes several personal projects such as a rubiks cube solver, a chess engine, and prediction model neural network for NBA games, aswell as an about page.

There are several django apps:

1. mysite - main django app
2. cube - most of the code for home page, about and ofcourse cube
3. etc - home page for nba predictions and other etc pages
4. predict - logic for nba predictons
5. users - handles all the users for nba
